            <header><h2>What is Go?</h2></header>
            <p> Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language. It  is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.</p>
            <p>There are two major implementations: </p>
            <code></code>
            <ul><li>Google's self-hosting[17] compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, mobile devices,[18] and WebAssembly.[19]</li><li>gccgo, a GCC frontend.[20][21]</li></ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="design">
            <header><h2>Design</h2></header>
            <p>Go is influenced by C, but with an emphasis on greater simplicity and safety. The language consists of:</p>
            <ul><li>A syntax and environment adopting patterns more common in dynamic languages:</li>
                <ul><li>Optional concise variable declaration and initialization through type inference (<code>x := 0</code> instead of <code>int x = 0;</code> or <code>var x = 0;</code>).</li>
                    <li>Fast compilation.</li>
                <li>Remote package management (go get)[48] and online package documentation.</li></ul></ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="syntax">
            <header><h2>Syntax</h2></header>
            <p>Go's syntax includes changes from C aimed at keeping code concise and readable. A combined declaration/initialization operator was introduced that allows the programmer to write i := 3 or s := "Hello, world!", without specifying the types of variables used. This contrasts with C's int i = 3; and const char *s = "Hello, world!";. Semicolons still terminate statements,[a] but are implicit when the end of a line occurs.[b] Methods may return multiple values, and returning a result, err pair is the conventional way a method indicates an error to its caller in Go.[c] Go adds literal syntaxes for initializing struct parameters by name and for initializing maps and slices. As an alternative to C's three-statement for loop, Go's range expressions allow concise iteration over arrays, slices, strings, maps, and channels.</p>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="types">
            <header><h2>Types</h2></header>
            <p>Go has a number of built-in types, including numeric ones (byte, int64, float32, etc.), booleans, and character strings (string). Strings are immutable; built-in operators and keywords (rather than functions) provide concatenation, comparison, and UTF-8 encoding/decoding.[53] Record types can be defined with the struct keyword.</p>
            <p>For each type T and each non-negative integer constant n, there is an array type denoted [n]T; arrays of differing lengths are thus of different types. Dynamic arrays are available as "slices", denoted []T for some type T. These have a length and a capacity specifying when new memory needs to be allocated to expand the array. Several slices may share their underlying memory.</p>
            <p>Pointers are available for all types, and the pointer-to-T type is denoted *T. Address-taking and indirection use the & and * operators, as in C, or happen implicitly through the method call or attribute access syntax.[58] There is no pointer arithmetic,[d] except via the special unsafe.Pointer type in the standard library.</p>
            <p>For a pair of types K, V, the type map[K]V is the type of hash tables mapping type-K keys to type-V values. Hash tables are built into the language, with special syntax and built-in functions. chan T is a channel that allows sending values of type T between concurrent Go processes.</p>
            <code>// ZeroBroadcast reports whether addr is 255.255.255.255.<br>
func (addr ipv4addr) ZeroBroadcast() bool {<br>
    return addr == 0xFFFFFFFF<br>
}</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="package_system">
            <header><h2>Package system</h2></header>
            <p>In Go's package system, each package has a path (e.g., "compress/bzip2" or "golang.org/x/net/html") and a name (e.g., bzip2 or html). References to other packages' definitions must always be prefixed with the other package's name, and only the capitalized names from other packages are accessible: io.Reader is public but bzip2.reader is not.[75] The go get command can retrieve packages stored in a remote repository [76] and developers are encouraged to develop packages inside a base path corresponding to a source repository (such as example.com/user_name/package_name) to reduce the likelihood of name collision with future additions to the standard library or other external libraries.</p>
            <p>Proposals exist to introduce a proper package management solution for Go similar to CPAN for Perl or Rust's cargo system or Node's npm system.</p>
